## py_hash_sigs

I had some time during my flight so I implemented the ideas outlined in [this](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2018/04/07/hash-based-signatures-an-illustrated-primer/) article. It's a few variations on purely hash-function based signature schemes. If you know anything about crypto, this idea will probably seem very very odd. Read the article for details, it's well written and pretty interesting.
  
Hash based signatures are coolio. Post quantum crypto is coolio.
